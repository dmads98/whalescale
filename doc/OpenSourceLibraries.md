Open Source Libraries:

Since we created this project while always updating a Pipfile for the backend and a package.json for the frontend, all of this information can be seen in each of those files respectively.
To access the Pipfile.lock file find it in the root directory.
To access the package.json file find it in the top level of the whalescale-frontend directory.
